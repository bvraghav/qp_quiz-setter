#+title: QP Quiz Setter

* Summary

Given a /QDB/ of multiple choice questions, this
package automatically creates /N/ “sets” of question
papers, so that each “set” is the same question paper
in randomised order of questions.  Furthermore, the
order of answer choices are also randomised, and the
key for each set is printed separately into a different
PDF.

* Usage

1. Ensure [[*System][system pre-requisites]].
2. Setup the QP Details: Open [[file:setter-py--content-prefix.txt][org-file-header-txt]] and
   1. L1: Update date;
   2. L19: Update Exam Name;
   3. L20: Update Course Code;
   4. L21: Update Course Name;
   5. L22: Update Time Duration;
   6. L23: Update MM;
   7. L24: Update Faculty Name;
   8. L29-43: Update Instructions;
3. Setup [[*Data][Data, /i.e. QDB/ and =images= folder]].
4. Create a relative symlink =qdb.csv= to point to the
   /QDB/
5. =make clean && make -j10 NUM_SETS=4 && make
   clean-minted=

* Pre-requisites

** System

I summarise my system requirements here.  So this is
definitely not the bare minimum system requirements. 

1. Linux System
2. [[https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/][MiniConda]] Python with [[https://github.com/bvraghav/dotemacs/blob/master/conda-env.yml][this env]].  /Required for
   Python/.
3. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] with [[https://github.com/bvraghav/dotemacs][BVR’s version of DotEmacs]].  /Required for
   =org-latex-export=/.
4. I recommend [[https://github.com/bvraghav/stow/tree/master][my userspace setup]]; but at least,
   [[https://github.com/bvraghav/stow/blob/master/user-home/.local/bin/fire_emacs][=fire_emacs=]] Wrapper for running Emacs daemon.  This
   [[https://github.com/bvraghav/stow/blob/master/user-home/.functions.zsh][Zsh function]] should help spawning an Emacs daemon
   with =fire_emacs=.  /Required for invoking
   =emacsclient=/.
5. [[https://tug.org/texlive/][TeXLive]], and [[https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html][LatexMk]].  /Required to compile TeX to
   PDF/.

** Data
1. Create /QDB/ as CSV file with following header:
   1. Header String: Q,A0,A1,A2,A3,A,A_MUL_P
   2. Q: Question Text;
   3. A0: Answer 0 Text;
   4. A1: Answer 1 Text;
   5. A2: Answer 2 Text;
   6. A3: Answer 3 Text;
   7. A: Correct Answer Index {0,1,2,3};
   8. A_MUL_P: Is the answer multi-line {0,1};
2. If using the [[https://github.com/bvraghav/qptiet_latex-class][=tiet-question-paper=]] $\LaTeX$ document
   class, also download the [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Jh2eAJR3h1HT28c8Hr3D0JChn2_4yLR][=images= folder]] to root
   folder.  The system degrades gracefully for any
   other use case, eg. =images= folder not available,
   or using any other $\LaTeX$ document class.  PS: The
   =images= folder link has restricted access; so, if
   required, please request access using a
   =@thapar.edu= email.

* Output

The output shall be available in the =dist= folder.
Two files of consequence are:
+ =all-sets.pdf=; and
+ =keys.pdf=.
